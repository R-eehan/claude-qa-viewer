# Session Q&A Viewer

A Claude Code skill that generates an interactive HTML visualization of all your Claude Code Q&A sessions.

Scans every session transcript, extracts each `AskUserQuestion` interaction — the questions Claude asked, your answers, and the surrounding conversation — and renders them as a filterable, dark/light mode HTML dashboard.

## Scope

**This reads ALL your Claude Code sessions across ALL projects by default.** It scans every `.jsonl` transcript in `~/.claude/projects/`. There is no option to filter by project or session at this time.

## Install as a Claude Code Skill

Clone directly into your skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/R-eehan/claude-qa-viewer.git ~/.claude/skills/session-qa-viewer
```

Then from **any Claude Code session**, in any directory:

```
/session-qa-viewer
```

## Run Directly (No Skill)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/R-eehan/claude-qa-viewer.git
node claude-qa-viewer/scripts/visualize-qa.js
```

## Where Can I Run This?

Anywhere. The skill reads from `~/.claude/projects/` which is a global location, so it works from any project directory. You don't need to be in a specific folder.

## Session Names

Session names displayed in the viewer are randomly generated by Claude Code. Use `/rename <name>` in any active session to give it a meaningful title. See the [Claude Code docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/interactive-mode#built-in-commands) for more.

## What You'll See

- **Q&A Cards** — every `AskUserQuestion` interaction, prominently highlighted with the question, options, and your answer
- **Conversation Entries** — Claude's messages and your messages shown as a readable back-and-forth, truncated with expand/scroll
- **Tool Call Pills** — compact single-line entries for Bash, Grep, WebSearch, etc.

## Features

- Light and dark mode with system preference detection
- Q&A-only filter mode

- Sticky navigation header with back-to-top button
- Zero external dependencies (Node.js built-in modules only)

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Claude Code with session history at `~/.claude/projects/`
